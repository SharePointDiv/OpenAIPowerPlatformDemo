## Summary
This is a demo app to show how we can connect and use OpenAI API and Azure OpenAPI inside Power Platform.

## Features
This solution includes OpenAI API Connector, Azure OpenAI API Connector and Canvas App to show how to use these connectors.

**OpenAI Custom Connector**:

**Canvas Apps**:

OpenAI Email Screen
* Using Completion API (Link) to improve email composition: 
    - Rewrite an email input or create a draft response for an Emailâ€™s input in a pre-desired format. 
    - Summarize or extract key points from an Email

OpenAI Images Screen
* Using Create Image API (Link) to generate new image(s) based on an input image.

Azure openAI Email Screen (only in **OpenAI Intergration with Power Apps V2**)
* Introduce how to replace the OpenAI powered Email Screen with Azure OpenAI service (if you do not have access to Azure Open API, you can just use the )

## Prerequisite
